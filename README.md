# TransferLearning-FeatureExtraction
Use state of the art image classification models from Tensorflow Hub

Here we are going to leverage image classification weights that are learnt by these predefined models,

Following is included here:

  Load & Prepare training and test images
  Identify location of the predefined model
  Create model that will be applied to our data
  Train & Evaluate model
  Explore model performance
